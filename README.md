# Color-Constancy-Prior


CPU based Matlab code of IEEE-Signal Processing Letters-2020 paper "An improved Air-light estimation scheme for single haze images using color constancy prior.
### Demo

Simply run demo.m will give an example of our dehazing methods. 

The code is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Matlab R2019a. It should work well on other operating systems like Windows.
